Evil-vs.-Good
=============

This is a game that my tame made for the class Game Development and Algorythmic Problem Solving II (September 2013 - December 2013).

Evil vs. Good was a five-person game project to be completed over a period of ten weeks. A traditional side-scrolling 
platformer with limited AI and simple movement, jumping, and shooting mechanics. 

Our game created a map from a text file in a grid of blocks. The player was able to navigate this grid, shoot spells at enemies, collide with
the terrain, and jump to avoid pits. Our game contained a Main Menu, Exposition/Story screen, Instruction screen, Pause screen, Game Over 
screen, and Level Complete screen.
 
I contributed to the game in several ways. I programmed player movement and very early on animation code,the physics with collisions and I
contributed to the jumping and shooting code. I also worked a lot on the back end by contributing to the setup through 
gameobject. My job was to also clean up the code us much as possible and offer help with whatever problems that others faced. A special note, 
the code wasn't always run through gameobject. At one point it was a less advanced framework and I was one of two people that restructured
the entire code and worked on the framework.
